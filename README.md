## Description

Goalie is a program that helps you track progress
towards your goals. Goalie is designed to be as
simple as possible.

## Setup

Here are the steps you will need to get up and
running

## 1) Launch the program

You will notice it asks you to create a profile.
You can leave the name as default or give it a
name like "Dylan's Savings".

You can also input the current savings that you
have. You don't have to do this yet, but it can
make the process easier.

## 2) Create your goals

Click the "New Goal" button. Give your goal a
name - this is what will show up on your homepage.
If you would like, you can start this goal
off from $0.00 or you can put in a balance if
you already have some money put towards this
goal.

Next is the most important part. You have three
options for saving money towards goals:

- Fixed amounts
- Percentage amounts
- Manual saving

By default, a goal will save 5% of your paycheck.
You will notice that the text box says "5" and
the drop-down next to it is set to "% (percentage
per paycheck)"

If you wanted to save \$5 per paycheck instead,
you could simply change the drop-down to the
"\$ (fixed amt / paycheck)" option

If you don't want money to be automatically
split between paychecks, you can simply
choose "Manual (nothing per paycheck)".

Now, input your goal. If you need $100.00 to
go out to dinner, then you'd input $100.00 here.
Note that not all goals need a fixed goal -
you have the option of simply saving money
without reaching a specific goal. If you
want to do this, leave this field blank or as $0.00

Finally, if you want to continue saving money
even after you've reached your goal (Imagine you 
reached the $100 goal to go out to dinner but
didn't spend it right away. You'd want to keep
saving money for the next dinner too!) keep that
option checked. If you want to only save exactly
the amount specified in the "Goal" option, uncheck
this option.

You can change these settings at any time by
clicking on the goal from the home screen

## 3) Enter yoru current money

The ultimate goal of this is to make the
"total savings" figure line up with the
money you have saved in your real bank account.

The easiest way to do this is to start off by
putting all of your savings into the "General Savings"
account. You can do this by simply clicking on it
and editing the "Balance" field.

Now, use the "Transfer Money" button from the home page.
Split up your current savings by transferring money
from the general savings account to your new goals.

Once you have all your general savings and goals
up-to-date, you're all done!

## After setup

After you're all set up, every time you get a paycheck,
simply press the "I Got Paid" button. Enter the amount
you got paid *after tax*. The program will split up your
paycheck for you!

To "spend" money, simply edit the account and reduce the
balance byt he correct amount.

To delete a goal, click the goal to open the edit screen
and then select the "Delete Goal" button.

**Important about deleting goals**: any money left in
the goal will be transferred to the general savings
account when you delete it. Make sure you change the
balance to $0.00 **and then press "Save" before you**
**delete the goal**! This only applies if you spent
all the money in that goal - if you want that money
to go back into your general savings, you can just
delete it.
